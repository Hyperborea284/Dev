Jim Messina, former President Barack Obama’s deputy chief of staff, is bringing some hefty lobbying guidance to a London-based cryptocurrency trading platform as the industry braces for new regulations in the U.S. and abroad.

The veteran political operative joined Blockchain.com’s board early last year, becoming a key advisor on its government relations and policy strategy, chief business officer Lane Kasselman said in an interview with CNBC.

The crypto industry has been ramping up lobbying around the world with potentially strict regulations on the horizon. The Biden administration released its framework on potential U.S. crypto regulations earlier this month, including ways that could help fight fraud.

Kasselman described Messina as a critical guide to the company’s lobbying and overall policy efforts. He noted that Messina is not a registered lobbyist, yet often advises their team on lobbying strategy.

“You can say that we are probably one of the most prolific companies when it comes to public policy engagement related in crypto globally, certainly in the U.S. and western Europe. That’s a direct result of Jim and his guidance on that front,” Kasselman said. Messina, who was Obama’s deputy chief of staff, is now the CEO of the consulting firm The Messina Group.

Though Messina is not a registered lobbyist, the Messina Group has provided guidance on lobbying and other policy issues to Uber, Pillpack, Airbnb, Google, Delta Air Lines and Hutchison Whampoa, according to a list of clients on its website.

Beyond his tenure advising Obama, Messina’s firm has also advised powerful government officials, including former UK Prime Ministers Theresa May and David Cameron, along with Mexico’s Enrique Peña Nieto, Argentina’s Mauricio Macri, and Italy’s Matteo Renzi. Messina tweeted out pictures of him in the White House as Obama and former First Lady Michelle Obama had their official portraits revealed.

Kasselman credits Messina with the company hiring Ian Mair as Blockchain.com’s head of U.S. policy and Giles Swan to run its European policy. Blockchain.com, which maintains U.S. headquarters in Miami, was also among a group of crypto companies that lobbied elements of the Digital Financial Assets Law, which would tighten oversight of the industry in California where many U.S.-based crypto firms are based. They “offered amendments and feedback” after the bill was introduced, Kasselman said. He said their “main amendment focus” was the bill’s “implementation period.”

If signed into law by Gov. Gavin Newsom, the bill would go into effect in 2025 and require companies, such as digital-asset exchanges, to obtain licenses through the state’s Department of Financial Protection and Innovation.

Kasselman also noted that Messina guided them on how best to lobby the European Parliament on its crypto regulation known as Markets in Crypto-assets rules.

Kasselman said they won their latest battle with members of the parliament and their staff as the EU was deciding “whether or not it would basically decide to make non custodial wallets illegal,” he said. These types of digital wallets, which Blockchain.com promotes on its website, act effectively as an ultra secure crypto savings account.

“It’s core to our business belief that we should give people control of their assets and protect it from all other potential interference. And Jim really made us think through ‘what is that argument, what’s going to work in Brussels? What is that those members of parliament are worried about and how do we address these concerns?’” Kasselman said. “And as a result of his counsel, having worked with heads of state across Europe for years, we crafted, I don’t want to call it a  campaign but sort of an argument that we went in and met with some of the ministers and won.”

Swan, the company’s head of European policy, met with the staff of EU commissioner of financial services, Mairead McGuinness, in May to discuss so-called transfer of funds regulation, according to a disclosure report. McGuiness has been critical of cryptocurrencies, and said digital assets were “one of the newest ways to launder money” in a tweet last year.

Biden on '60 Minutes' drew far fewer viewers than Obama, Trump on the same show
Jeff Mordock
7-9 minutos

President Biden’s appearance on “60 Minutes” this week may have given the venerable news program a ratings bounce, but he still drew a smaller audience than his two immediate predecessors.

Roughly 10 million people spent Sunday night watching Mr. Biden on the CBS news magazine, according to data from the Nielsen company.

That was 40% of the 24.5 million viewers who turned in to “60 Minutes” to watch President Obama’s first post-election interview in November 2008. It was the show’s highest ratings in more than a decade.

Mr. Obama’s follow-up appearance in December 2019, after he left office, drew 16.2 million, according to Nielsen data.

President Trump attracted 16.8 million total views when sat down for a contentious interview with “60 Minutes” correspondent Lesley Stahl in October 2020.

Republicans say they weren’t surprised by Biden’s TV ratings.

“No wonder the ratings were so poor: Americans knew Biden was going to lie about his failed record. Soaring grocery costs, out-of-control crime, and an unsecured southern border are top of mind for voters,” said Republican National Committee spokesman Nathan Brand. 

Although Mr. Biden pulled lower numbers, it is hard to compare the ratings for each president. Television ratings are influenced by a multitude of factors, including competing shows and world events. The ratings drop may also reflect an overall decline in viewership for “60 Minutes” over the past few years.

The ratings for Mr. Trump’s 2020 appearance managed to top both a World Series game and a “Sunday Night Football” matchup which both aired at the same time. But Mr. Biden this week brought in half as many viewers as “Sunday Night Football.”

The Bears-Packers game on Sunday was the highest-rated program of the week ending Sept. 18, scoring nearly 20 million viewers. NBC’s football pregame show that ran against a portion of Mr. Biden’s interview attracted roughly 14.6 million viewers, according to Nielsen’s data.

Mr. Biden’s appearance on “60 Minutes” was only the nonfootball show among the eight highest-rated shows last week.

Although Mr. Biden was no match for the NFL, he did help boost the ratings for “60 Minutes,” which has been on the air since 1968.

In the spring, the news magazine averaged roughly 7.6 million viewers and was the highest-rated prime-time program for five out of nine weeks at the beginning of this year.

The interview with Mr. Biden was the first the president had with an American TV journalist in nearly seven months. The last time Mr. Biden did a network television interview was on Feb. 10 with NBC News.

Michelle Obama announces tour for new book

Former first lady Michelle Obama will travel across the United States this fall on a tour for her new book, "The Light We Carry."

"I'm so excited to share that I'm bringing 'The Light We Carry" book tour to a city near you,'" the former first lady said in a taped message. "I hope to see you there."

Obama will kick-off the tour Nov. 15, in Washington, D.C., before heading to Philadelphia, Atlanta, Chicago, San Francisco and Los Angeles.

No details were released about whether guests will join Obama on the tour.

"Becoming" detailed Obama's journey from growing up on the South Side of Chicago to becoming first lady of the United States.

Her new book, "The Light We Carry: Overcoming in Certain Times," was inspired by the challenges of the past several years, including the coronavirus pandemic, political turmoil and divide in the country, and the conversations she's had with loved ones and others.

In a July Instagram post, she described the book as a "collection of stories and practices that have helped me sort through all the challenges and questions that keep us up at night: How do I know I’m good enough? How do I bring my whole self to the table? How can I overcome my fears?"

"I think of it as kind of a toolbox, a collection of some of the perspectives and practices I’ve gathered over the years to help keep me centered even during times of high anxiety and stress," she said. "And my hope is that we can equip ourselves with new tools and attitudes so that, together, maybe we’ll be a little steadier, with the understanding that none of us has to go through this alone."

"The Light We Carry" will be published on Nov. 15, 2022, in 14 languages and 27 countries around the world, according to the book's publisher, Crown, an imprint of Random House.

Tickets for the book tour will go on sale to the general public on Sept. 30.

Obama also plans to give away a "select number" of tickets at each stop to people in the community, according to Crown.

NEW YORK

Michelle Obama plans a six-city tour this fall in support of her new book, “The Light We Carry: Overcoming in Uncertain Times,” beginning mid-November in Washington. D.C. and ending a month later in Los Angeles.

“I’m looking forward to making some new connections — and of course, seeing some familiar faces from the last tour,” the former first lady said in a joint statement Wednesday released through her publisher, Crown, and tour promoter Live Nation.

“This book means so much to me — it’s a collection of perspectives and practices I’ve used to keep me afloat amid uncertainty. On this tour, I’ll be sharing some personal stories and lessons that have helped me along my path, and I can’t wait to tell you more.”

Obama will open at the Warner Theatre in Washington on Nov. 15, the publication date for her book. She will then travel to Philadelphia's The Met, Atlanta's Fox Theatre, the Chicago Theatre and San Francisco's Masonic, before closing at the YouTube Theater in Los Angeles.

The venues have seating capacities ranging roughly from 2,000-6,500. The settings are far bigger than for most book events, but smaller than Obama's stops on the first leg of her tour for the 2018 memoir “Becoming," when she appeared at the United Center in Chicago and other arenas holding 15,000 or more.

“Becoming” was a near-instant million seller and went on to sell more than 17 million copies worldwide, making it the most popular book in modern times written by a former White House resident.

As with “Becoming,” Obama will speak at each city with guest moderators, to be announced later. Oprah Winfrey, Tracee Ellis Ross and Sarah Jessica Parker were among those who joined her for “Becoming.” In partnership with Live Nation, Obama will also set aside tickets at each venue for a select number of community members.

_____

Fans can begin registering from Wednesday through Sept. 26 through Ticketmaster's Verified Fan Platform, https://verifiedfan.ticketmaster.com/michelleobama. Any unsold tickets will be available to the general public starting Sept. 30.
